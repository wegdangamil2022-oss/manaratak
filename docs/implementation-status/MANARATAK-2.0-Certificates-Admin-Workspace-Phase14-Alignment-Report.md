**Date:** July 28, 2026  
**Phase Target:** Phase 23 (Enterprise Administration Portal) & Phase 14 (Certificates Engine Platform)  
**Related Domain Phases:** Phase 13 (Courses & Learning Platform), Phase 15 (Student Workspace & Profile), Phase 05 (EAP Enterprise Assets Platform), Phase 24 (Enterprise Public Platform Composition)

## 1. Executive Summary

This report documents the implementation and architectural alignment of the **Certificates Admin Workspace** within MANARATAK 2.0 Enterprise Administration Portal (`@manaratak/admin` / Phase 23).

The workspace establishes a secure, compliant control-plane surface for issuing, verifying, revoking, and managing official certificate templates across student accomplishment programs while strictly adhering to cross-phase boundaries and governance rules.

## 2. Key Architecture & Domain Boundaries

1. **Phase 14 Ownership (Certificates Engine Platform):** Owns certificate issuance, verification, revocation, template definitions, digital signatures, and certificate lifecycle.
2. **Phase 13 Ownership (Courses & Learning Platform):** Owns course completion verification, academic progress, grades, and student eligibility.
3. **Phase 15 Ownership (Student Workspace):** Owns student profile and identity data.
4. **Phase 05 Ownership (EAP Enterprise Assets Platform):** Owns certificate PDF files, logos, and signature asset handles via EAP Asset Ref IDs.
5. **Phase 23 Ownership (Enterprise Administration Portal):** Owns admin UI, issuance request queues, template management, and operational controls.
6. **Phase 24 Ownership (Enterprise Public Platform):** Owns public verification page composition (`/verify-certificate`).
7. **Strict Boundary Rules:**
   - No editing student grades or course progress from Certificates Admin.
   - No editing course curriculum content from Certificates Admin.
   - No raw file URLs in UI; all PDF/media assets referenced via Phase 05 EAP asset handles.
   - No auto-issuance without verified eligibility from Phase 13 or explicit authorized admin action with audit reason.
   - **Strict Permanent Deletion Prohibition:** Issued certificates can NEVER be deleted permanently. Issued certificates can only be revoked with a mandatory documented reason and immutable audit trail.
   - Public verification page exposes verification status and protected student references without leaking private personal data.
