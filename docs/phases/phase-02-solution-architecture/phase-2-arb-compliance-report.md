### 2. Executive Summary

This report presents the official **Comprehensive Architecture and Compliance Review** executed by the Architecture Review Board (ARB) for the MANARATAK 2.0 platform. The audit covers all governing principles, domain structures, logical and physical database schemas, API contracts, and supporting systems established across **Phase 1 (System Vision & Requirements Alignment)** and **Phase 2 (Detailed Enterprise Solution Design)**.

The primary objective is to verify that the system design exhibits absolute consistency, enforces complete domain sovereignty, mitigates over-engineering risks, and guarantees relational and operational integrity before physical development commences in Phase 3.

### 3. Comprehensive Compliance Review & Audit

#### 3.1 Architectural Consistency Analysis (تحليل الاتساق المعماري)

The ARB conducted a rigorous multi-directional audit to detect discrepancies between the High-Level Governing Principles (Phase 1) and the Concrete Technical Deliverables (Phase 2):

- **The Vision vs. Payload Symmetry**: Phase 1 demands strict bilingual compliance. The review confirms that every JSON schema in the _REST API Contracts (v2.13)_ and _Canonical Data Model (v2.7)_ strictly embeds symmetrical parallel structures (e.g., `text_ar` and `text_en`). No single-language properties exist in the public-facing endpoints.
- **Transactional Outbox Consistency**: Phase 1 mandates decoupled service interactions. Phase 2 correctly implements this by prohibiting direct cross-context API calls for mutating transactions. All state changes write to a local `TransactionalOutbox` table in the same ACID boundary, which is processed asynchronously by the _Event Foundation (v2.14)_.
- **Identity and Role Alignment**: The RBAC scopes specified in _Identity Security (v2.15)_ map 1:1 to the security filters and gateway routing layers defined in _API Architecture Design (v2.12)_.

##### Analysis & Recommendations Matrix:

| Checked Aspect            | Current State (الوضع الحالي)                                                        | Compliance Level (مدى الامتثال) | Final ARB Recommendation (التوصية المعمارية النهائية)                        |
| :------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-----------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bilingual Symmetries**  | Symmetrical English/Arabic data properties present on all core models.              |       **100% compliant**        | Approved. Block deployment of any model schema missing bilingual structures. |
| **Domain Communication**  | Decoupled asynchronous eventing using transactional outbox logs.                    |       **100% compliant**        | Approved. Enforce local transactional logging for all cross-context events.  |
| **Access Control Claims** | RBAC claims (`ROLE_STUDENT`, `ROLE_COORDINATOR`, etc.) verified at the API Gateway. |       **100% compliant**        | Approved. Gateway must validate token signatures before routing traffic.     |

#### 3.2 Sovereignty & Separation Check (فحص العزل وفصل الصلاحيات)

A critical risk in complex relational systems is schema lock contention between highly static taxonomic data (Lookups) and fast-mutating, transactional core entities (Rich Domains):

- **Physical Isolation of Reference Data (Phase 4 Lookups)**: The ARB confirms that global static lookup taxonomies (e.g., ISO Country Codes, Currency Tables, Standardized Degree Level classifications) are stored in independent tables inside the `manaratak_academic_db` or localized caches.
- **Zero Cross-Database Physical Foreign Keys**: To prevent database locks, there are **no physical database foreign-key constraints** linking core tables in the _Scholarship Context_ (`manaratak_scholarship_db`) or _Student Profile Context_ (`manaratak_profile_db`) to static reference tables.
- **Logical flat-key referencing**: Connections are represented purely by logical, flat business keys (e.g., `lookup_degree_code` string values). Downstream services query reference data from highly indexed, read-optimized local caches or isolated lookup endpoints, completely preventing schema lock propagation.

##### Analysis & Recommendations Matrix:

| Checked Aspect          | Current State (الوضع الحالي)                                        | Compliance Level (مدى الامتثال) | Final ARB Recommendation (التوصية المعمارية النهائية)                                 |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ | :-----------------------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Schema Isolation**    | Decoupled database partitions for Lookups and Rich Domains.         |       **100% compliant**        | Approved. Strictly forbid cross-schema foreign keys at the database server level.     |
| **Relational Coupling** | Logical string-based referencing used instead of physical FK joins. |       **100% compliant**        | Approved. Reference tables must be indexed heavily and served from redis/local cache. |

#### 3.3 Over-Engineering Detection (كشف فخاخ التضخم المعماري)

Early architectural planning is prone to over-engineering, which introduces code rot and increases maintenance overhead. The ARB reviewed CMS Articles, Student Portfolios, and Application states to purge complex subsystems:

- **Elimination of Advanced Document Versioning**: Initial drafts of the CMS architecture proposed Git-like incremental text versioning engines. The ARB rejected this as an over-engineered pattern. The CMS structure now uses a simple, lean `RevisionHistory` log storing atomic snapshots, maintaining a minimal storage footprint.
- **Simplification of the Workflow Engine**: The _Workflow Foundation (v2.16)_ was audited to ensure it does not include heavy distributed BPEL/BPMN engines. Instead, the platform implements a lightweight, deterministic **State Machine Pattern** executed in-memory at the domain level.
- **Prevention of Code Duplication (Post-Roadmap cleanup activity)**: The ARB has verified that data processing, validation, and de-duplication rules are centralized within the _Import Pipeline Context_ Anti-Corruption Layer, ensuring zero duplicate parser code exists across core repositories.

##### Analysis & Recommendations Matrix:

| Checked Aspect          | Current State (الوضع الحالي)                                      | Compliance Level (مدى الامتثال) | Final ARB Recommendation (التوصية المعمارية النهائية)                                |
| :---------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- | :-----------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CMS Versioning**      | Simple linear revision log replacing multi-branch diff engines.   |       **100% compliant**        | Approved. Keep CMS history linear; reject branching models.                          |
| **Workflow Complexity** | In-memory State Machine replacing heavyweight BPMN middleware.    |       **100% compliant**        | Approved. Limit state transitions to deterministic domain-level rules.               |
| **Parser Logic**        | Normalized validation logic centralized in the ACL Import engine. |       **100% compliant**        | Approved. Prevent developers from implementing custom parser logic in core contexts. |

#### 3.4 Explicit Integrity Check (فحص تكامل العلاقات الصريحة)

In the _Scholarship Application Bounded Context_, representing applications dynamically across different pathways can lead to polymorphic relational tables, which are fragile and difficult to index or audit:

- **Prohibition of Polymorphic Joins**: The ARB has strictly banned loose, polymorphic schema designs (e.g., tables using arbitrary `target_type` and `target_id` strings to resolve associations).
- **Mandatory Nullable Explicit Foreign Keys**: In Prisma and physical database models, relations must be expressed as **Explicit, Symmetrical, Nullable Foreign Keys**.
- **Prisma Schema Representation**: For instance, an `Application` entity maps connections to specific potential targets through clear, independent relational fields (e.g., `scholarship_id` referencing `Scholarship` and `pathway_id` referencing `Pathway`). These keys are explicitly indexed, nullable, and fully auditable by relational planners.

##### Analysis & Recommendations Matrix:

| Checked Aspect           | Current State (الوضع الحالي)                                      | Compliance Level (مدى الامتثال) | Final ARB Recommendation (التوصية المعمارية النهائية)                            |
| :----------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- | :-----------------------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Relational Integrity** | Explicit, nullable FK fields replacing loose polymorphic strings. |       **100% compliant**        | Approved. Enforce strict database indexes on all nullable explicit foreign keys. |
| **Auditability**         | Direct relational joins easily mapped by SQL optimizer planners.  |       **100% compliant**        | Approved. Relational queries must remain direct and index-compliant.             |
