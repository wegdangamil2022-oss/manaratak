## 23.C.1 Administration Workflow Philosophy

**Architectural Commentary**  
The administration workflow philosophy dictates that every operation inside the Administration Portal follows a structured operational pipeline. The architecture prohibits ad-hoc data manipulation or un-audited state changes.

Administrative tasks move through defined stages. Enforcing strict adherence to these operational pipelines guarantees that every administrative action is transparent, traceable, and fully auditable under Phase 05 security logging.

---

## 23.C.2 Unified Content Lifecycle

**Architectural Commentary**  
To prevent operational fragmentation, all educational content entities abide by a consistent administrative review lifecycle.

This lifecycle applies to roadmap-scoped entities, including:
- Scholarships (Phase 12)
- Universities (Phase 11)
- Courses (Phase 13)
- Articles & Guides (Phase 16 - Enterprise CMS)
- Educational Services (Phase 20)
- Educational Tools (Phase 18)

The standard administrative content lifecycle flows as follows:

**Import Ingestion (Phase 06)**  
->  
**Domain Validation Check (Domain Engine)**  
->  
**Administrative Review (Phase 23)**  
->  
**Metadata Editing & Enrichment (Phase 23)**  
->  
**Translation Review (Phase 23 / Phase 17)**  
->  
**Quality & Compliance Verification (Phase 23)**  
->  
**Publication Approval Command (Phase 23)**  
->  
**Public Composition & Rendering (Phase 24)**  

This unified flow ensures administrators experience identical operational paradigms across all catalog domains.

---

## 23.C.3 Workflow Integration

**Architectural Commentary**  
Administrative views operate as processing nodes within an integrated pipeline. The architecture enforces seamless handoffs between ingestion, editing, translation, and publication control.

A representative operational integration pipeline flows as follows:

**Import Review View (Phase 23)**  
->  
**Domain Management View (Phase 23)**  
->  
**Translation Review View (Phase 23 / Phase 17)**  
->  
**Publication Command Surface (Phase 23)**  
->  
**Public Page Composition (Phase 24)**  

Operational views communicate continuously, automatically advancing entities to their next logical administrative state without manual data re-entry.

---

## 23.C.4 Administration Task Flow

**Architectural Commentary**  
The Administration Portal proactively guides administrators toward pending work by surfacing entities in actionable task queues.

Tasks dynamically move through administrative queues based on lifecycle status:
- Pending Initial Triage & Review
- Pending Translation Verification
- Pending Publication Approval
- Pending Metadata Correction
- Expired Offering Alerts
- Failed Validation Warnings
- System Operational Notifications

This proactive task routing ensures that content never stagnates in an unmonitored state and operational bottlenecks remain immediately visible.

---

## 23.C.4.1 Review Queue Aggregate Control-Plane Workflow

**Architectural Commentary**  
The Review Queue (`/admin/review-queue`) is defined strictly as a read-only aggregate pending-work control plane ("نظرة عامة على قائمة المراجعة"). It provides a cross-domain operational summary of pending work without duplicating domain editing or management workflows.

**Operational Boundary & Workflow Rules:**
1. **Aggregate Overview Only:** Displays cross-domain summary metrics, aggregate cards per domain module (Scholarships, Universities, Majors, Courses, International Tests, Educational Services, CMS Articles), reason breakdown counts, and a filtered read-only pending work queue.
2. **No Direct Domain Editing or Mutating Actions:** Direct record-level editing, publishing, deleting, or "accept all completed" bulk actions are strictly forbidden and removed from the Review Queue interface to eliminate operational risk and duplicate management workflows.
3. **Domain Workspace Handoff:** Every item action is a navigation link ("Open in Workspace" / "فتح في لوحة المجال") routing the administrator to the domain admin workspace (`/admin/scholarships`, `/admin/universities`, `/admin/majors`, `/admin/courses`, `/admin/international-tests`, `/admin/services`, `/admin/cms`). Domain admin workspaces remain the single source of truth for record modification, approval, publishing, import, and lifecycle actions.
4. **Safe Interactive Filters:** Allows filtering pending work by Domain, Review Reason (Needs Translation, Missing Required Fields, Ready to Publish, Source Verification Required, Recently Imported), Priority, Source Type, and Record Age.
5. **Operational Notice Banner:** Displays an explicit read-only governance banner clarifying that content modification and lifecycle actions take place exclusively within domain workspaces.

## 23.C.4.2 Generic Import Control Plane Workflow & Domain Import Centers

**Architectural Commentary**  
The Import Management framework operates as a two-tier, multi-domain Import Control Plane for data ingestion across all supported platform catalog modules.

**Architecture Architecture & Workflow Rules:**
1. **Tier 1: Generic Overview (`/admin/imports`):** Displays simple domain summary cards for all 7 platform domains (Scholarships, Universities, Majors, Courses, International Tests, Educational Services, CMS Articles), active source connectors summary, and a read-only Import Operations Center (IOC) audit log.
2. **Tier 2: Dedicated Domain Import Centers (`/admin/imports/:domainKey`):** Clicking "Start Import" on any domain card routes the administrator to a domain-isolated control view (`/admin/imports/scholarships`, `/admin/imports/universities`, `/admin/imports/majors`, `/admin/imports/courses`, `/admin/imports/international-tests`, `/admin/imports/services`, `/admin/imports/cms`).
3. **Domain Provider / Source Cards:** Each Domain Import Center hosts domain-specific provider cards (e.g., DAAD, Chevening, Coursera, edX, ISCED, IELTS/TOEFL) displaying source types, trust scores (0-100%), source URLs, last check times, and metrics (imported, transferred, incomplete, failed).
4. **6-Step Import Wizard:** Clicking "Start Import From This Source" launches an execution stepper:
   - **Step 1: Confirm Domain & Source:** Verifies domain workspace handoff path and trust score warnings.
   - **Step 2: Input Method Selection:** File upload (CSV/JSON), Paste payload, Official URL reference (1 URL only, staged for review notice), Registered Connector, or Demo dataset.
   - **Step 3: Processing Limits:** Selects batch size boundary (10, 50, 100, or custom small limit) to prevent timeout failures.
   - **Step 4: Admin Engine Rules:** Toggles operational instructions (e.g., focus postgrad, ignore expired, require official URL, mark missing deadline as Needs Review, import bilingual text) and custom notes.
   - **Step 5: Review Run:** High-contrast summary review before batch execution.
   - **Step 6: Run Batch & Execution Results:** Executes batch, transfers valid records to domain workspace as `Needs Review`, quarantines incomplete items, logs failed items, and confirms zero auto-publishing.
5. **Phase Ownership Delegation:** Phase 23 controls UI, navigation, and administrative orchestration only. Phase 06 owns generic ingestion mechanics (CSV/JSON parsing, batching, error queues). Domain phases own field validation schemas, completeness rules, deduplication, and public publishing.
6. **Safety Rules:** No auto-publishing, no uncontrolled multi-page web crawling (1 official URL reference only), no global unsafe actions ("Run all", "Stop all"), and no public exposure until approved inside the domain admin workspace.

## 23.C.5 Administration Experience Principles

**Architectural Commentary**  
The administrator experience prioritizes operational velocity and human efficiency. The portal is an enterprise work environment engineered for high-throughput management.

The administrator experience is defined by:
- Operational simplicity and layout consistency
- Minimal required clicks for routine approvals
- Rapid navigation between task queues
- Centralized task observability
- Deterministic, predictable system responses
- Reduced manual data repetition

---

## 23.C.6 Public Platform Command & Visibility Synchronization

**Architectural Commentary**  
Phase 23 acts as the administrative command surface for visibility, availability, and feature configuration. Phase 23 issues administrative commands (publish, unpublish, feature toggle) via domain APIs and event dispatchers. Phase 24 - Enterprise Public Platform owns final public page composition, visitor routing, SEO rendering, and visitor-facing page state.

Administrative commands dispatched from Phase 23 govern:
- Publishing and unpublishing content records
- Setting visibility flags and featured item selections
- Activating or deactivating module feature toggles
- Updating homepage service display configurations

---

## 23.C.7 Operational Scalability & Scope Bounds

**Architectural Commentary**  
The administrative architecture acts as a durable, extensible surface strictly for approved roadmap-scoped entities within the fixed 24-phase roadmap.

Future workflow expansions are bounded to:
- Integrating admin review views for Phase 17 AI models and automated translation flows.
- Enhancing moderation queues for Phase 20 service requests and Phase 21 career metadata.
- Extending operational telemetry views over domain read-models.

Phase 23 strictly prohibits adding unapproved domain workflows or creating phases beyond Roadmap v6.0.

---

## 23.C.8 Enterprise Operational Principles

**Architectural Commentary**  
These foundational principles govern the execution and governance of all administrative workflows:
- Single Source of Truth (SSoT) for domain records
- Workflow Consistency across all catalog views
- Centralized Security & Auditability (Phase 05)
- Operational Transparency and Task Traceability
- Seamless Cross-Phase Delegation
- Fixed 24-Phase Roadmap Compliance

---

## 23.C.9 Course Administration Workflow

**Architectural Commentary**
Phase 23 enforces a strict tollgate review workflow and provides comprehensive administrative screens for course authoring, media management, curriculum building, assessment creation, and publication review.
**Read-only handoff indicator**: Phase 13 - Learning Platform remains the authoritative owner of course domain execution, curriculum logic, learning progress, and completion rules. Phase 23 provides admin UI/control plane only. Phase 14 owns certificates, Phase 19 owns payments, and Phase 05 EAP owns physical media files.

**Course Management Overview**
The admin experience includes:
- **Course management overview table**: Lists all draft, under-review, published, and archived courses.
- **Filters**: Filter by course type, status, language, level, category, paid/free, origin, publication state, and import state.
- **Audit history panel**: Displays chronological record of all administrative changes to course state.
- **Validation/error panel**: Displays warnings and blockers preventing course publication.

**Add Course Wizard & Editor**
Administrators build native courses or manage imported courses through a step-by-step editor:

1. **Course Metadata Step**:
   - Configure course type/origin: `NativeManaratakCourse`, `ExternalLinkedCourse`, `PaidCourse`, or `RelatedPaidService` (as cross-link only).
   - Configure language, level, duration, category/tags, target majors/disciplines, and prerequisites.
   - Configure instructor/provider metadata.

2. **Curriculum Builder Step**:
   - Build modules and lessons via a drag-and-drop ordering interface.
   - Select lesson type: Video, Text, PDF, Quiz, Assignment, External link, Mixed media.
   - Configure required/optional markers, estimated duration, and lock/unlock/prerequisite rules between modules or lessons.

3. **Media/Assets Step (EAP Integration)**:
   - Upload and attach learning assets (Course thumbnail, cover image, video, images, PDFs, subtitles, audio, SCORM, downloadable materials, preview assets).
   - **Boundary Enforcement**: Phase 23 interacts exclusively via Phase 05 EAP selection components. Warnings are shown if media is not registered through EAP. Phase 23 must not store physical paths or raw URLs.

4. **Quiz, Exam, and Question Bank Step**:
   - Create assessments (quizzes, exams, assignments) and centralized question banks.
   - Add/edit question types (Multiple choice, True/false, Short answer, Essay, Matching, Ordering, File upload).
   - Configure difficulty, tags, randomized pools, attempt limits, timer settings, passing score, manual review flag, auto-grading settings, and feedback fields.

5. **Pricing Step (Paid Courses)**:
   - Mark a course as paid.
   - Assign a Phase 19 price reference.
   - The UI displays payment readiness state and checkout availability.
   - **Safety Warning**: Displays warnings when a paid course lacks Phase 19 payment readiness or refund/settlement dependencies.

6. **External/Free Course Review Step**:
   - Review imported global external course records.
   - Verify direct course URL and free study / free certificate indicators.
   - Approve, reject, or mark incomplete for missing mandatory fields.
   - **Safety Warning**: Displays warnings when an external course is paid but mistakenly marked as global free, or triggers admin review for source trust concerns.

7. **Review and Publish Step**:
   - Public preview step to visualize the course detail page prior to publishing.
   - Enforce publishing constraints: Warnings when attempting to publish incomplete course structures.
   - Transition visibility through draft/review/approval/published/archived lifecycles.

### 23.C.9.1 Imported External Courses Operational Workflow

## 23.C.10 Educational Tool Administration Workflow

**Operational Philosophy**
Phase 23 provides the governance dashboard for the Official Tool Registry Backlog (owned by Phase 18). It allows administrators to safely manage tool lifecycles without interfering with execution logic.

**Tool Registry Administration Experience**
The admin experience includes the following workflows and controls:
- **Registry Overview Table:** Displays all tools synced from Phase 18.
- **Filters:** Allows filtering by category, execution type (Deterministic, AI-Delegated, Hybrid, Admin/Internal), visibility, priority, lifecycle, AI dependency, and dependency health.
- **Detail Drawer/Page:** Drill-down into each tool for configuration.
- **Enable/Disable Toggle:** Soft switch to instantly halt a tool's execution capability. Requires a reason input for the audit log.
- **Visibility Controls:** Toggle a tool between `ACTIVE`, `COMING_SOON`, `UNDER_DEVELOPMENT`, `HIDDEN_ADMIN_ONLY`, `DISABLED`, and `RETIRED`.
- **Priority Controls:** Adjust `P1_CORE_LAUNCH`, `P2_EXPANSION`, `P3_LATER` for engineering queues.
- **AI Cost-Risk Indicator:** Visual highlight showing token usage cost estimation profiles for AI-Delegated or Hybrid tools.
- **Dependency Health Panel:** Real-time ping checking the health of required domain APIs (e.g., Phase 11 for Universities) and Phase 17 for AI.
- **Audit History Panel:** Timeline of all admin actions (who changed what visibility, when).

**Boundary Enforcements & Safety Warnings**
- **Read-Only Registry Source Indicator:** A persistent badge indicating that tool metadata and execution logic belong to Phase 18, and Phase 23 is acting purely as a control plane.
- **Admin/Internal Tool Safety:** The system throws a strict warning if an admin attempts to expose `HIDDEN_ADMIN_ONLY` tools (like Import Completeness Checkers) to Phase 24 public pages.
- **Anonymous AI Warning:** The system warns the admin if expensive `AI_DELEGATED` tools are set to allow anonymous execution, highlighting the denial-of-wallet risk.

- **Duplicate & Safe Merge Visibility**: Displays original source name versus normalized canonical name, duplicate status (`new`, `duplicate_skipped`, `existing_enriched`), merged fields, and conflicting fields flagged for review.
- **Empty State**: When no majors exist, displays "No majors found", "Add Major", and "Open Majors Import Center" (routing to `/admin/imports/majors`).

---

## 23.C.14 International Tests Admin Workspace & Import Center Workflow

**Operational Philosophy**
Phase 23 provides the administrative command center for reviewing, normalizing, validating, approving, and publishing standardized international tests (e.g., IELTS, TOEFL, SAT, GRE, GMAT), owned by Phase 09. Raw exam feed ingestion and batch processing are strictly separated and handled by the dedicated Tests Import Center under `/admin/imports/international-tests`.

**Important Phase Ownership Clarification:**
- `/admin/international-tests` is exclusively owned by Phase 09.
- `/admin/international-tests/:id` is exclusively owned by Phase 09.
- `/admin/imports/international-tests` is the dedicated import center route (mechanics by Phase 06, control by Phase 09).
- `/admin/majors` is exclusively owned by Phase 10 (Academic Majors) and must not be mixed with Phase 09 (International Tests).

**International Tests Admin Workspace Experience (`/admin/international-tests`)**
- **Vertical Administrative List**: A lightweight, mobile-friendly vertical list/table for fast scanning. The list page must explicitly show:
  - Test name
  - Provider / issuing body
  - Test category
  - Score range or minimum score summary
  - Result validity duration
  - Approximate fee metadata
  - Completeness status
  - Lifecycle status
  - Source verification status
  - Direct navigation button to open the detailed view at `/admin/international-tests/:id`
  - Button/link to `/admin/imports/international-tests` for import workflows

  - Missing Data (`ناقصة البيانات`)
  - Needs Source Verification (`تحتاج تحقق من المصدر`)
  - Ready to Publish (`جاهزة للنشر`)
  - Published (`منشورة`)
  - Archived (`مؤرشفة`)
- **Import Button Behavior**: All import actions route directly to `/admin/imports/international-tests` rather than triggering inline raw import modals from the main list view. No direct raw imports are permitted within the main test profile view.

**Unified International Test Details View (`/admin/international-tests/:id`)**
Each test profile must support these twelve admin-managed data groups:
1. **Core Test Identity**: Canonical test name, localized Arabic/English names, abbreviation/common name, test category (e.g., `LANGUAGE_PROFICIENCY`, `UNDERGRAD_ADMISSION`, `GRAD_ADMISSION`, `PROFESSIONAL_LICENSING`, `ACADEMIC_PLACEMENT`, `OTHER`), official provider/issuing body, lifecycle status, public visibility status, and source verification status.
2. **Test Versions / Variants**: Variant name (e.g., IELTS Academic, IELTS General Training, TOEFL iBT, SAT Digital), delivery mode (`ONLINE`, `IN_PERSON`, `HYBRID`), active/inactive status, specific official URL per variant, and administrative notes explaining difference from other variants.
3. **Score System**: Overall score minimum and maximum, score increment if applicable, section score ranges, bands/levels if applicable, pass/fail rules if applicable, CEFR or cross-test equivalency references if available, result validity duration (e.g., 2 years), result delivery time, and score reporting URL.
4. **Test Sections**: Section name, section type, duration, order, question types, and section score minimum and maximum.
5. **Fees and Currency Metadata**: Registration fee, currency code, regional price variation flag, late registration fee, rescheduling fee, cancellation fee, and fee validity window. 
   - *Pricing Disclaimer*: Phase 09 stores fee metadata only; Phase 19 (Finance) owns actual payment execution. No payments are processed in Phase 09.
6. **Registration and Policy Requirements**: Registration requirements, identification document requirements, age rules if applicable, retake policy, cancellation/rescheduling notes, and accessibility/accommodation notes.
7. **Availability**: Available countries (using Phase 07 Reference Data), available cities/test centers if known, online availability regions, and testing windows or session availability.
   - *Reference Disclaimer*: All countries, cities, languages, and currencies belong strictly to Phase 07 Reference Data.
8. **Official Links and Source Verification**: Official registration URL, official information URL, official preparation URL, score reporting URL, source URL, source name, last verified timestamp, source trust classification, and link health status.
9. **Preparation Materials and Assets**: Official sample question links, practice test URLs, preparation PDFs/brochures, listening/audio sample references, and guide assets.
   - *Strict Asset Rule*: All persisted files must use Phase 05 EAP `AssetId` / `AssetReference`, not raw file paths or arbitrary URLs.
10. **Cross-Phase References**: 
    - Related universities/program requirements from Phase 11 (references only)
    - Related scholarships from Phase 12 (references only)
    - Related preparation courses from Phase 13 (references only)
    - Related CMS guides from Phase 16 (references only)
    - Related student tools from Phase 18 (references only)
    - Related paid services from Phase 20 (references only)
    - *No Duplication Rule*: No duplication of downstream domain records inside Phase 09 is permitted.
11. **Import, Evidence, and Review**: Original imported name, normalized canonical name, deterministic key, `sourceId`, `sourceUrl`, `contentHash`, `retrievedAt`, `evidenceSnippet`, validation results, duplicate status, conflicting fields, merge suggestions, and admin review status.
    - *Automation Rule*: Confidence or source trust scores must never cause automatic publishing.
12. **Missing Data and Publication Readiness**: Missing mandatory fields, incomplete optional fields, source verification warnings, outdated fee warnings, and unavailable registration link warnings.
    - *Readiness Statuses*: `IMPORTED`, `INCOMPLETE`, `COMPLETE`, `NEEDS_REVIEW`, `READY_TO_PUBLISH`, `PUBLISHED`, `REJECTED`, `ARCHIVED`.

**Source and Import Policy:**
- **Authoritative Source Priority**: Official sources (e.g., ETS, British Council, College Board) are the authoritative source for canonical facts.
- **Supporting Source Rule**: Non-official/supporting sources may be used for enrichment of missing details only. They must never silently overwrite official or admin-reviewed fields.
- **Conflict Management**: Any conflicting fields between sources must be flagged for admin review and manual merge decisions.
- **Trust Indicator Rule**: Source confidence and trust classifications are advisory only. They must never trigger automatic merging or automatic publishing.
- **Clear Architectural Boundary**: Phase 06 owns raw import mechanics only. Phase 09 owns validation, deduplication, completeness checks, review, and final apply decisions.

**Publication Rules:**
- **Visibility Guard**: A public preview or public page link must appear only when the record status is explicitly `PUBLISHED`.
- **Restricted Access**: Staged, `IMPORTED`, `INCOMPLETE`, `NEEDS_REVIEW`, and `READY_TO_PUBLISH` records must remain strictly admin-only.
- **No Public Leakage**: No staged, unreviewed, or unsupported imported test data may ever be displayed publicly on Phase 24 pages.

**Admin Action Bar**: Top action bar supporting Edit, Verify / Approve (`توثيق / اعتماد`), Mark Ready to Publish (`جاهز للنشر`), Publish (`نشر`), Unpublish (`إلغاء النشر`), Reject (`رفض`), Archive (`أرشفة`), Fetch Missing Fields from Official Source (`جلب النواقص من المصدر الرسمي`), and Link Test to Scholarships / Universities (`ربط الاختبار بالمنح / الجامعات`). Mandatory confirmation required for dangerous actions. Public page links appear ONLY when status is Published. Real Phase 09 API endpoints must be utilized for all backend actions once implemented; placeholder paths are strictly non-final.

**"Fetch Missing Fields from Official Source" Action**: Button ("Fetch Missing Fields from Official Source" / "جلب النواقص من المصدر الرسمي") checking official provider portals and suggesting missing fields only. Displays Arabic safety message and a preview modal before saving. Never overwrites reviewed or admin-approved fields silently.

**Duplicate & Safe Merge Visibility**: Displays original source name versus normalized canonical test name, duplicate status (`new`, `duplicate_skipped`, `existing_enriched`), merged fields, and conflicting fields flagged for review. Deduplication considers normalized test name, provider/owner, and test category to prevent duplicate tests for the same exam.

**Empty State**: When no tests exist, displays "No international tests found" (`لم يتم العثور على اختبارات دولية`), "Add Test" (`إضافة اختبار`), and "Open Tests Import Center" (`فتح مركز استيراد الاختبارات`, routing to `/admin/imports/international-tests`).

## 23.C.15 Native Courses Admin Workspace & Authoring Operational Workflow

**Operational Philosophy**
Phase 23 provides the administrative command center for authoring, reviewing, structuring, and publishing native MANARATAK courses (owned by Phase 13). The Courses Admin Workspace is explicitly split into three sections: Native MANARATAK Courses (`/admin/courses/native`), Imported External Courses (`/admin/imports/courses`), and Paid Courses (`/admin/courses/paid`).

**Section 1: Native MANARATAK Courses Experience (`/admin/courses/native`)**
- **Native Authoring Isolation**: Native MANARATAK Courses are authored directly inside MANARATAK and are NOT imported courses. They do not trigger external scraping or import feeds.
- **Vertical Administrative List**: A lightweight vertical list displaying course title (Arabic/English), category/field, level (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced), language, price type (Free/Paid/Draft Pricing), lifecycle status, instructor name, certificate enabled badge, and a direct "View Details" navigation button to `/admin/courses/native/:id`. Full curriculum modules, lesson lists, question banks, and media files are excluded from the main list view to maintain maximum visual clarity.
- **Top Statistics Dashboard**: 8 explicit counters for All Native Courses (`كل دورات منارتك`), Draft (`مسودة`), Under Review (`قيد المراجعة`), Ready to Publish (`جاهزة للنشر`), Published (`منشورة`), Archived (`مؤرشفة`), Certificate Enabled (`الشهادة مفعلة`), and Missing Content (`محتوى ناقص`).
- **Create Native Course Wizard**: An authoring overlay button ("Create Native Course" / "إضافة دورة منارتك") featuring 6 structured steps:
  1. *Course Basics*: Title Ar/En, short description, category/field, level, language, instructor, cover image via Phase 05 EAP Asset ID, free/paid pricing flag.
  2. *Curriculum Builder*: Module creation, lesson ordering, lesson duration, lesson type (video, text, file, link, quiz).
  3. *Media & Attachments*: Uploaded video, PDF, and image assets stored strictly via Phase 05 EAP Asset Ref IDs.
  4. *Assessments & Question Bank*: Question bank drafting (MCQ, True/False, Short Answer), module quizzes, final exam configuration, passing score percentage, attempt limit.
  5. *Certificate Configuration*: Enable certificate boolean, Phase 14 template reference ID. Explicitly notes that Phase 14 owns certificate generation & issuance upon student completion; admin configures eligibility rules here.
  6. *Review & Publish Readiness*: Content completeness warnings, curriculum completeness check, assessment completeness check, media readiness check, initial status transition (Draft -> Under Review -> Ready to Publish -> Published).
- **Native Course Detail View (`/admin/courses/native/:id`)**: Comprehensive profile displaying course basics, curriculum modules & lessons, media assets via EAP IDs, assessments & question bank, certificate settings (Phase 14 note), pricing & payment metadata (Phase 19 note), publishing status, completeness checklist, and admin activity audit history.
- **Admin Action Bar**: 11 explicit actions: Edit (`تعديل`), Add Module (`إضافة وحدة`), Add Lesson (`إضافة درس`), Add Assessment (`إضافة اختبار`), Manage Question Bank (`إدارة بنك الأسئلة`), Manage Media (`إدارة الوسائط`), Enable/Configure Certificate (`تفعيل/إعداد الشهادة`), Mark Ready to Publish (`جاهزة للنشر`), Publish (`نشر`), Unpublish (`إلغاء النشر`), Archive (`أرشفة`). Dangerous actions require confirmation. No auto-publish.
- **Domain Boundaries**: Phase 13 owns native course curriculum, modules, lessons, question banks, assessments, course progression, and course publishing. Phase 05 EAP owns uploaded media/assets. Phase 14 owns certificate generation/issuance upon completion. Phase 19 owns checkout/payment execution for monetized courses. Phase 20 owns non-course paid student services and must NOT own or reclassify native courses as services. Phase 23 owns admin UI/control-plane only. Phase 24 owns public rendering only.

## 23.C.16 CMS Administration Editorial Operational Workflow

**Operational Philosophy**
Phase 23 provides the administrative control plane for editorial and marketing content management (owned by Phase 16). The CMS Admin Workspace is organized into 6 clear sections: Articles & Guides (`/admin/cms/articles`), FAQs (`/admin/cms/faqs`), Static Pages (`/admin/cms/pages`), Categories & Tags (`/admin/cms/categories`), Translations (`/admin/cms/translations`), and Content Review Queue (`/admin/cms/review`).

**Editorial Workspace Experience**
- **Articles & Guides (`/admin/cms/articles`)**: Lightweight vertical list showing article title, content type (Article, Study Guide, News, Checklist), category, language, status, and view details action. Detailed rich text editing, SEO metadata configuration, EAP featured image linking, and translation payloads are managed inside `/admin/cms/articles/:id`.
- **FAQs Management (`/admin/cms/faqs`)**: Manages guided questions and approved answers organized by category.
- **Static Pages (`/admin/cms/pages`)**: Manages platform static pages (About, Privacy, Terms, Contact, Custom).
