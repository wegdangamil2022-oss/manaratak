## 23.A.1 Administration Portal Vision

**Architectural Commentary**  
The Administration Portal serves as the unified administrative command center orchestrating operational workflows across the MANARATAK ecosystem. It provides administrators with a single, cohesive management environment for reviewing content, monitoring platform health, executing moderation tasks, and configuring operational parameters.

The vision for Phase 23 is to function as a centralized administrative operating surface. It abstracts underlying domain services and databases into unified review dashboards and control panels. Crucially, Phase 23 owns administrative interfaces and orchestration workflows, while delegating core domain business logic, data persistence, and public rendering to their respective domain platforms across the fixed 24-phase roadmap.

---

## 23.A.2 Administration Philosophy

**Architectural Commentary**  
The architectural mandate for MANARATAK relies on administrative convergence. The platform is intentionally designed around a single, centralized administration portal user experience.

There are strictly no fragmented administrative panels scattered across different domains. Every administrative operation-whether reviewing a university record, auditing a course listing, or approving a scholarship opportunity-is performed from one unified administration environment.

The architectural benefits of this centralized philosophy include:
- **Elimination of Administrative Silos:** Operational workflows and task queues live in a single, predictable interface.
- **Uniform Security Governance:** Identity, role-based access control (RBAC/ABAC), and audit logging are uniformly governed by Phase 05 infrastructure contracts.
- **Operational Cohesion:** Administrators utilize consistent interaction patterns across all roadmap domains without toggling between disparate management tools.
- **Maintainable Management Surfaces:** System updates to administrative layouts and component libraries deploy centrally without interface version drift.

---

## 23.A.3 Administrative Users & Security Governance

**Architectural Commentary**  
The security architecture of the Administration Portal is grounded in strict access governance, identity verification, and complete operational auditability.

Administrative users are defined and governed as follows:
- **System Owner (Primary Administrator):** Operates with governed super-admin authority constrained strictly by Identity and Access Management (Phase 05), RBAC/ABAC rules, mandatory audit logging, maker-checker approval chains, and emergency policy bounds.
- **Backup Administrator (Emergency Administrative Access):** Operates as a break-glass access role with full audit logging, multi-factor verification, and time-bound revocation rules, utilized strictly for business continuity and disaster recovery.
- **Delegated Administrative Roles:** Scoped roles (e.g., Content Reviewer, Translation Reviewer, Moderation Agent) configured with least-privilege permissions mapped to specific administrative views.

---

## 23.A.4 Administration Dashboard Philosophy

**Architectural Commentary**  
The Administration Dashboard acts as an operational read-model command view. Following the Phase 23 Governance Sprint, its design philosophy strictly avoids vanity metrics or fake KPIs, focusing entirely on actionable, enterprise-wide observability, system readiness, and audit safety derived from domain platform telemetry.

To prevent operational accidents, high-risk direct pipelines (e.g. immediate database backups, mass broadcasting, and AI recommendation matching weight adjustments) are explicitly demoted to non-interactive protected placeholders labeled with their appropriate integration requirements (e.g., *Requires production integration*, *Requires approval workflow*, *Requires dedicated module*).

The Dashboard is structurally organized into six safe control-plane modules:
1. **System & Services Status Indicators:** Displays real-time status signals for APIs, database preview mode, Redis queue integration blockers, import engines, and administrative authentication.
2. **Pending Review & Quality Verification Queue:** Serves as an aggregate control-plane overview of pending work across platform domain modules (Scholarships, Universities, Majors, Courses, International Tests, Services, CMS). Crucially, the Review Queue does not own domain review logic, nor does it edit, publish, import, or delete domain records directly. Domain workspaces remain the sole source of truth for detailed review and lifecycle actions; Phase 23 only composes pending-work read models and routes administrators to the appropriate domain admin workspace.
3. **Generic Import Control Plane:** Serves as a multi-domain control plane for data ingestion across all platform modules (Scholarships, Universities, Majors, Courses, International Tests, Services, CMS). The main Import Management page (`/admin/imports`) provides a generic multi-domain overview with domain summary cards, active sources summary, and read-only import operations audit tables. Clicking 'Start Import' on any domain card routes to a dedicated Domain Import Center page (`/admin/imports/:domainKey`) featuring domain-specific provider cards (e.g. DAAD, Chevening, Coursera, edX, ISCED, IELTS/TOEFL) and a 6-step Import Wizard. Crucially, Phase 23 controls UI/navigation only; Phase 06 owns generic import mechanics, while domain phases retain sole authority over validation schemas, completeness classification, deduplication, and domain workspace transfer handoffs without auto-publishing or uncontrolled web crawling.
4. **Content Public-Publishing Readiness Metrics:** Evaluates content completeness and readiness scores for public release.
5. **Safe Quick Shortcuts:** Offers direct links to scoped management panels (Imports, Review Queue Overview, Scholarships, Universities, Diagnostics, and RBAC Settings).
6. **Safe Operational & Audit Activity Log:** Exposes read-only, non-deletable audit trails of admin actions. Destructive operations (such as deleting audit entries) are strictly forbidden to ensure data compliance.

Every module presented serves a direct operational decision-making purpose, enabling administrators to monitor platform health, verify ingestion completeness, and dispatch safe commands efficiently.

## 23.A.5 Unified Content Lifecycle & Admin Workflows

**Architectural Commentary**  
In an enterprise ecosystem, operational workflows must follow structured pipelines. The administration architecture mandates that content review and moderation follow a unified administrative lifecycle.

No administrative view operates in isolation. Every workflow natively advances content through defined administrative gates:

**Import Ingestion (Phase 06)**  
->  
**Triage & Review (Phase 23)**  
->  
**Metadata Enrichment & Editing (Phase 23 / Domain APIs)**  
->  
**Translation Review (Phase 23 / Phase 17)**  
->  
**Publication Approval (Phase 23)**  
->  
**Public Composition & Rendering (Phase 24)**  

This operational pipeline applies consistently across scholarships (Phase 12), universities (Phase 11), courses (Phase 13), articles (Phase 16), educational services (Phase 20), educational tools (Phase 18), and all approved roadmap-scoped entities.

---

## 23.A.6 Administrative Simplicity

**Architectural Commentary**  
Enterprise control does not require cognitive clutter. The Administration Portal is engineered to prioritize administrative efficiency and clear task focus.

The portal strictly adheres to the following principles:
- **Simple:** Stripped of unnecessary visual noise and redundant navigational layers.
- **Organized:** Hierarchically structured so that related management tasks reside in predictable locations.
- **Fast:** Instantaneous data retrieval and command execution using optimized read-models.
- **Practical:** Focused entirely on operational fulfillment without theoretical abstractions.
- **Efficient:** Minimizing clicks and context switches required to complete moderation tasks.

---

## 23.A.7 Cross-Phase Boundaries & Domain Delegations

**Architectural Commentary**  
Phase 23 owns administrative UI screens, moderation workflows, review queues, approval dashboards, operational command surfaces, and cross-domain administrative orchestration. Phase 23 explicitly does NOT own domain business logic, data schemas, or runtime execution services.

Domain ownership boundaries are strictly delegated across the 24-phase roadmap as follows:
- **Phase 05 - Identity & Access Infrastructure:** Owns IAM, RBAC/ABAC authorization policies, audit logging, break-glass security rules, and EAP asset handles.
- **Phase 06 - Ingestion & ETL Pipelines:** Owns import mechanics, feed parsers, raw data extraction, and ETL transformation jobs.
- **Phase 07 - Country Architecture:** Owns country reference data, geographical models, and country taxonomy validation.

## 23.A.8 Tool Administration Governance

**Architectural Commentary**
Phase 23 owns admin screens, dashboards, controls, and governance workflows for managing the visibility and operational status of tools. Phase 23 does not own tool definitions, tool execution, AI execution, deterministic logic, generated outputs, or public presentation.

Domain ownership mapping for tool governance:
- **Phase 18 - Enterprise Student Tools Platform** remains the owner of the Official Tool Registry Backlog, tool metadata, execution orchestration, tool lifecycle model, input/output schemas, and execution contracts.
- **Phase 17 - Enterprise AI Platform** remains the only owner of AI execution, prompts, model routing, provider integrations, safety filters, and AI cost governance.
- **Phase 24 - Enterprise Public Platform** remains the public presentation and composition owner for public tool pages.
- **Phase 15 - Enterprise Student Platform** remains the authenticated student workspace owner for saved results, private usage history, and dashboard embedding.
- **Phase 05 - Core Implementation / Enterprise Asset Platform** remains the owner of generated files and persisted assets through AssetId / AssetReference.
- **Phase 19 - Enterprise Finance & Payments Platform** owns payment execution if a tool becomes paid or monetized.

**Admin Capability Requirements**
The Administration Portal must support management of:
- Tool enable/disable status.

**Admin/Internal Tool Governance**
Explicitly, Admin/Internal tools from Phase 18 (such as import completeness checkers, duplicate review helpers, missing-data assistants, imported record deduplication reviewers, and source trust reviewers) are managed only through Phase 23 admin workflows. 
- These tools must never be exposed on public Phase 24 pages.
- Phase 23 may provide admin UI for these tools, but does not own their validation authority.
- Phase 06 - Import Foundation owns generic import mechanics only. 
- Each downstream domain owns its own import schemas, rules, deduplication authority, enrichment authority, and publish-readiness decisions (Phase 10 - Major Platform, Phase 11 - Universities & Institutions, Phase 12 - Scholarships, Phase 13 - Learning Platform).

**Paid Course Administration**
The admin workflow must support:
- Mark course as paid.
- Assign price reference or pricing configuration through Phase 19-approved integration.
- Display payment readiness state, checkout availability, and refund/settlement dependency notes.
- **Boundary**: Phase 19 owns payment execution, invoices, refunds, and settlement. Phase 13 owns course access rules after payment confirmation. Phase 23 only displays/administers configuration and status.

**Scholarship Admin Workspace & Import Center Boundaries**
The administration architecture enforces a strict separation of concerns between raw data ingestion and scholarship lifecycle management:
- **Scholarship Admin Workspace (`/admin/scholarships`)**: Dedicated to review, editing, naming normalization inspection, completeness classification, safe missing-field merging, approval, publishing, unpublishing, rejection, and archiving of scholarship records.
- **Scholarship Import Center (`/admin/imports/scholarships`)**: Dedicated to ingestion controls, source provider feeds, and batch processing. The Scholarship Admin Workspace does not manage raw provider feeds or execute raw ingestion engines directly.
- **Fetch Missing Fields Workflow**: An admin-triggered enrichment action ("Fetch Missing Fields from Official Source" / "جلب النواقص من المصدر الرسمي") that checks official source URLs and suggests missing fields only (benefits, majors, criteria, documents, deadlines, links). It never overwrites previously reviewed/admin-approved fields silently and always requires explicit administrator preview and confirmation.
- **Publication & Public Visibility**: No auto-publish is permitted. Public visibility on Phase 24 public pages occurs exclusively after manual administrative publishing. Public links are accessible only when status is Published.
- **Boundaries**: Phase 23 owns admin UX composition only. Phase 12 owns scholarship naming normalization, deduplication, completeness classification, safe merge rules, and domain lifecycle rules. Phase 06 owns generic import mechanics. Phase 24 owns public rendering.

**University Admin Workspace & Import Center Boundaries**
The administration architecture enforces a strict separation of concerns between raw data ingestion and university lifecycle management:
- **University Admin Workspace (`/admin/universities`)**: Uses a lightweight vertical list for quick scanning. Detailed management, review, editing, naming normalization inspection, completeness classification, safe missing-field merging, approval, and publishing occur inside the dedicated University Details page (`/admin/universities/:id`).
- **University Import Center (`/admin/imports/universities`)**: Dedicated to ingestion controls, source provider feeds, and batch processing. The University Admin Workspace does not manage raw provider feeds or execute raw ingestion engines directly.
- **Fetch Missing Fields Workflow**: An admin-triggered enrichment action ("Fetch Missing Fields from Official Website" / "جلب النواقص من الموقع الرسمي") that checks official website URLs and suggests missing fields only (logo, faculties, programs, requirements, tuition, accreditations). It never silently overwrites previously reviewed/admin-approved fields and always requires explicit administrator preview and confirmation.
- **Publication & Public Visibility**: No auto-publish is permitted. Public visibility on Phase 24 public pages occurs exclusively after manual administrative publishing. Public links are accessible only when status is Published.
- **Boundaries**: Phase 23 owns admin UX composition only. Phase 11 owns university domain data, official-source validation, deduplication, completeness rules, and university lifecycle. Phase 06 owns generic import mechanics. Phase 24 owns public rendering.

**Majors Admin Workspace & Import Center Boundaries**

- **Majors Admin Workspace (`/admin/majors`)**: Uses a lightweight vertical list for quick scanning (displaying major name, degree level, college/field, CIP/ISCED code, job demand level, and status). Detailed management, review, editing, naming normalization inspection, completeness classification, safe missing-field merging, approval, and publishing occur inside the dedicated Major Details page (`/admin/majors/:id`).
- **Majors Import Center (`/admin/imports/majors`)**: Dedicated to taxonomy ingestion controls, CIP/ISCED feeds, and batch processing. The Majors Admin Workspace does not manage raw provider feeds or run raw CIP/ISCED sync engines directly.
- **Fetch Missing Fields Workflow**: An admin-triggered enrichment action ("Fetch Missing Fields from Trusted Source" / "جلب النواقص من مصدر موثوق") that checks trusted major/classification sources (CIP, ISCED, official program catalogs) and suggests missing fields only (classification code, academic field, degree level mapping, description, acquired skills, career outcomes, related majors, typical courses). It never silently overwrites previously reviewed/admin-approved fields and always requires explicit administrator preview and confirmation.
- **AI Description Suggestion Workflow**: An admin-triggered AI feature ("Suggest Student-Friendly Description" / "اقتراح وصف مبسط للطلاب"). Phase 17 generates a draft only, which must never publish automatically and requires administrative review and approval before becoming active.
- **Publication & Public Visibility**: No auto-publish is permitted. Public visibility on Phase 24 public pages occurs exclusively after manual administrative publishing. Public links are accessible only when status is Published.
- **Boundaries**: Phase 23 owns admin UX/control-plane composition only. Phase 10 owns major domain data, naming normalization, deduplication, completeness rules, and major lifecycle. Phase 08 owns taxonomy, degree levels, and classification hierarchy governance. Phase 06 owns generic import mechanics. Phase 16 owns reviewed editorial publishing where applicable. Phase 17 only provides AI draft suggestions. Phase 24 owns public rendering.

**International Tests Admin Workspace & Import Center Boundaries**
The administration architecture enforces a strict separation of concerns between raw exam data ingestion and standardized tests lifecycle management:
- **International Tests Admin Workspace (`/admin/international-tests`)**: Uses a lightweight vertical list for quick scanning (displaying test name, official provider/owner, minimum required score/range, validity duration, status, and view details action). Detailed management, review, editing, naming normalization inspection, completeness classification, safe missing-field merging, approval, and publishing occur inside the dedicated Test Details page (`/admin/international-tests/:id`).
- **Tests Import Center (`/admin/imports/international-tests`)**: Dedicated to ingestion controls, exam provider feeds, and batch processing. The International Tests Admin Workspace does not manage raw provider feeds or execute raw ingestion engines directly.
- **Fetch Missing Fields Workflow**: An admin-triggered enrichment action ("Fetch Missing Fields from Official Source" / "جلب النواقص من المصدر الرسمي") that checks official provider websites (ETS, British Council, College Board) and suggests missing fields only (official registration URL, test fee/currency, test centers, available countries, validity duration, score scale, registration requirements, preparation links, sample material asset references via Phase 05 EAP). It never silently overwrites previously reviewed/admin-approved fields and always requires explicit administrator preview and confirmation.
- **Publication & Public Visibility**: No auto-publish is permitted. Public visibility on Phase 24 public pages occurs exclusively after manual administrative publishing. Public links are accessible only when status is Published.
- **Boundaries**: Phase 23 owns admin UX/control-plane composition only. Phase 09 owns international test domain data, test naming normalization, deduplication, completeness rules, fee/score/center metadata, and test lifecycle. Phase 06 owns generic import mechanics. Phase 05 EAP owns sample/preparation asset references. Phase 19 owns payment processing for paid services if applicable. Phase 24 owns public rendering.

**Courses Admin Workspace Architecture & Section Separation Boundaries**
The administration architecture enforces a strict tripartite division within the Courses Admin Workspace:
- **Courses Landing Workspace (`/admin/courses`)**: Presents three distinct, dedicated section cards separating Native MANARATAK Courses, Imported External Courses, and Paid Courses.
- **Native MANARATAK Courses Workspace (`/admin/courses/native`)**: Dedicated exclusively to courses authored directly inside MANARATAK. Native courses are NOT imported courses and are created/authored natively.
  - **Lightweight Vertical List**: Displays course title, category/field, level (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced), language, price type (Free/Paid/Draft Pricing), status, and view details action. Detailed curriculum, modules, lessons, question banks, media assets, and certificate settings are managed exclusively inside the Native Course Detail page (`/admin/courses/native/:id`).
  - **Native Authoring Wizard**: A 6-step creation wizard (Course Basics -> Curriculum Builder -> Media & Attachments via EAP -> Assessments & Question Bank -> Certificate Settings -> Review & Publish Readiness).
  - **Domain Ownership & Boundaries**: Phase 13 owns native course curriculum, modules, lessons, question banks, assessments, course progression, and course publishing. Phase 05 EAP owns uploaded video, PDF, and image assets via EAP Asset Ref IDs. Phase 14 owns certificate generation and issuance upon student completion (Admin configures eligibility criteria and template reference IDs only; Phase 13 does not issue certificates directly). Phase 19 owns checkout, payment execution, and subscriptions for monetized courses (Phase 13 sets store pricing metadata only). Phase 20 owns non-course paid student services and must NOT reclassify native courses as services. Phase 23 owns admin control-plane composition only. Phase 24 owns public rendering only.

## 23.A.10 Scope Creep Prevention & Roadmap Scalability

**Architectural Commentary**  
The Administration Portal acts as an extensible chassis strictly for approved roadmap-scoped modules within the fixed 24-phase roadmap.

Future administrative enhancements are constrained to:
- Adding configured admin views for approved roadmap-scoped entities.
- Integrating admin governance controls for Phase 17 AI services and translation workflows.
- Enhancing operational telemetry dashboards over existing domain read-models.
- Expanding role-based administrative task routing within Phase 05 security policies.

Phase 23 strictly prohibits the creation of unapproved domain entities, standalone external platforms, or expansion beyond the baselined 24-phase architecture.

---

## 23.A.10.1 Courses Administration Tripartite Structure

## 23.A.15 AI Governance & AI Center Administration Architecture

**Architectural Identity & Purpose**  
The AI Governance / AI Center Admin Workspace within Phase 23 provides the central control-plane UI for Phase 17 (Enterprise AI Platform). It governs model routing, provider health, prompt repository management outside codebase, AI translation workflows, workload processing queues (BullMQ), privacy redaction, and operational limits across MANARATAK 2.0.

**Architectural Principles & Boundaries**  
1. **Unified AI Service Boundary (`AIService`):** All domain modules, student tools (Phase 18), translations, and recommendations must call the internal `AIService.routeRequest()` orchestrator. Domain modules are strictly forbidden from directly calling external AI provider APIs (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, DeepSeek).
2. **Phase Ownership Breakdown:**
   - **Phase 17 (AI Platform Engine):** Owns AI routing, provider failover, prompt repository, BullMQ queue, privacy redaction, and safety limits.
   - **Phase 18 (Student Tools):** Owns student-facing UX for CV generation, motivation letters, and academic recommendations.
   - **Phase 16 (CMS & Editorial Content):** Owns editorial review and final publishing approvals for AI-generated translations and content.
   - **Phase 15 (Student Workspace & Profile):** Owns student private identity data (which is strictly redacted before model pass-through).
   - **Phase 23 (Enterprise Administration Portal):** Owns admin control-plane UI, provider toggles, prompt editor, task tracking, and queue controls.
3. **Strict Privacy & Key Masking:**
   - Raw API keys/secrets are NEVER rendered or returned in UI payloads; only masked configuration status (`Configured` / `Missing`) is exposed.
   - Raw student PII is redacted in AI logs and audit views.
4. **No Unreviewed Auto-Publishing:** AI-generated text, translations, and summaries MUST pass through Phase 16 editorial/CMS review or domain workflows before becoming public or approved.

## 23.A.16 Health & Readiness Admin Monitoring Architecture

**Architectural Identity & Purpose**  
The Health & Readiness Admin Workspace (`/admin/health`) in Phase 23 provides non-destructive, read-only operational telemetry and readiness monitoring across all underlying MANARATAK 2.0 subsystems. It enables administrators to inspect component statuses, latency metrics, incident logs, and production deployment readiness without performing destructive data or queue reset operations.

**Architectural Principles & Boundaries**  
1. **Non-Destructive Control Plane:** The Health & Readiness workspace is strictly limited to safe monitoring actions (Re-run health checks, Test connection, View logs, Download readiness report, Copy diagnostic summary, Open affected admin section). Destructive controls (Data purge, DB reset, Queue wipe, Secret rotation) are strictly prohibited on this page.
2. **Phase Ownership & Delegation:**
   - **Phase 23:** Owns the admin monitoring UI shell, diagnostic reports, and readiness checklist.
   - **Infrastructure Packages:** Own actual API/Prisma/Redis health check implementations.
   - **Phase 06:** Owns Import Foundation health details.
   - **Phase 05:** Owns Enterprise Assets Platform (EAP) storage health.
   - **Phase 17:** Owns AI Center provider health.
   - **Phase 19:** Owns Payment Gateway sandbox/production mode health.
3. **Preview / Runtime Mode Awareness:** Displays clear banner indicators when running in Google AI Studio preview containers where external Redis or production payment endpoints are simulated or safely isolated.
4. **Strict Security & Privacy Guard:** No raw API keys, database connection strings, JWT secrets, or unmasked credentials may be exposed in diagnostic outputs.

## 23.A.17 Admin Settings & Access Control Architecture

**Architectural Identity & Purpose**  
The Admin Settings & Access Control Workspace (`/admin/settings`) in Phase 23 serves as the administrative control plane for managing platform access, admin user identities, role-based permission matrices, access policies, feature flags (module visibility), read-only environment integration status, and security audit logs across all 24 phases of MANARATAK 2.0.

**Architectural Principles & Boundaries**  
1. **Safe Access Control Plane:** The Settings workspace manages admin access policies and role matrices. Permanent deletion or suspension of the Root Super Admin (`usr_root_01`) is strictly prohibited.
2. **Phase Ownership & Delegation:**
   - **Phase 23:** Owns the admin control plane UI, admin user list, roles & permission matrices, feature flag states, and access audit logs.
   - **Backend Security Foundation:** Owns underlying JWT session token generation, password hashing, and MFA verification.
   - **Phase 17:** Owns AI provider execution and key routing.
   - **Phase 19:** Owns payment gateway processing.
   - **Phase 05:** Owns EAP asset storage configuration.
3. **Strict Secrets Isolation:** All API keys, database URLs, JWT signing secrets, and tokens MUST be displayed in masked format (`Masked / Configured`). Raw secret values are never rendered or returned in UI response payloads.
4. **Granular 15-Module Permission Matrix:** Permission scopes are explicitly categorized across all 15 core admin modules (Scholarships, Universities, Majors, Courses, International Tests, Services, CMS, Student Tools, Certificates, Finance, Careers, Import Management, AI Governance, Health/Readiness, Settings) with 9 permission types (View, Create, Edit, Review, Publish, Archive, Import, Export, Manage Settings).
