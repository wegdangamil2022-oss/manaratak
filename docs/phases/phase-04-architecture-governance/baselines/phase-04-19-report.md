# Phase4.19 Report

## Implementation Summary

The Security Foundation has been successfully established following strict enterprise guidelines. Core security concerns (Rate Limiting, CSRF tokens) have been abstracted in the `@manaratak/core` layer and concretely implemented in `@manaratak/infrastructure`. The `SecurityMiddlewareFactory` ensures configurable integration of vital HTTP headers via `helmet`, CORS logic, and an IP-based request rate limiter. All parameters (e.g. rate limit windows, allowed CORS origins) are dynamically read from the Configuration Foundation, ensuring perfect separation of concerns without hardcoding any business or deployment rules.

## Security Validation

- **Security Isolation:** Established. Security middlewares strictly validate headers and limits decoupled from feature routing.
- **Configuration Isolation:** Verified. Variables are supplied by the `EnvironmentLoader` configuration mechanisms, avoiding direct `process.env` references.
- **Rate Limiter Neutrality:** Verified. A generic counter/window store functions as the baseline IP rate limiter.
- **CSP/CORS Neutrality:** Verified. Options inject entirely unopinionated arrays and rulesets configured via environment variables.
- **Zero Business Security Policies:** Verified. No domain-level blocklists, rule sets, or role policies exist within these modules.

## Compilation Status

`npm run build` executed successfully across the entire monorepo with 0 TypeScript compilation errors.

## Architecture Validation

- **Clean Architecture:** Enforced.
- **DDD Boundaries:** Enforced.
- **SOLID Principles:** Enforced.
- **Security Isolation:** Confirmed.
- **Dependency Rule:** Compliant.
- **Zero Business Leakage:** Verified successfully.
