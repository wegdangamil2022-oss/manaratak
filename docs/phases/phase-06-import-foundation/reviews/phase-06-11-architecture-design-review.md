## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the architectural design for the Import Validation Foundation within MANARATAK 2.0. Validation represents a declarative architectural abstraction describing validation semantics within the Import Foundation. It strictly separates the validation definition from its runtime resolution while enforcing immutability and maintaining complete independence from validation algorithms, rules, execution engines, and orchestration.

## 2. Validation Architecture

The Validation Architecture establishes the structural foundation for validation abstractions. It relies on purely declarative constructs that define what validation is, independently of how it is executed or processed.

- **Declarative & Immutable:** Validation constructs are defined once and cannot be mutated.
- **Domain-Agnostic & Technology-Independent:** Validation abstractions hold no business logic, domain knowledge, or technology assumptions.
- **Unidirectional Dependency:** Dependencies flow strictly downward, preserving architectural integrity.

## 3. Validation Identity

`IValidationIdentity` provides a globally unique and stable identifier for a Validation Definition.

- **Role:** Uniquely identifies a validation construct and its version.
- **Dependency:** Does not depend on or reference Metadata or Definition.

## 4. Validation Definition

`IValidationDefinition` represents the immutable, declarative, and unresolved description of validation semantics.

- **Role:** Encapsulates the metadata and generic properties defining the validation contract.
- **Characteristics:** Reusable, unresolved, and technology-independent.
- **Dependency:** Strictly owns `IValidationMetadata`.

## 5. Validation Metadata

`IValidationMetadata` contains contextual and structural information about the Validation Definition.

- **Role:** Holds the validation identity, declarative compatibility model, and conceptual display information.
- **Dependency:** Strictly owns `IValidationIdentity` and `IValidationCompatibility`. Owned by `IValidationDefinition`.

## 6. Validation Context

`IValidationContext` provides arbitrary generic contextual state required at the Validation Resolution Boundary.

- **Creator:** Instantiated by the architectural consumer orchestrating the resolution boundary.
- **Owner:** The Validation Resolution Boundary while resolution is structurally occurring.
- **Consumers:** Runtime components participating in resolution.
- **Lifecycle:** Bound exclusively to the lifecycle of a specific resolution boundary interaction.
- **Disposal:** Discarded immediately after the resolution boundary completes.
- **Immutability:** Strictly immutable from the perspective of all consumers; consumers must never mutate it.

## 7. Validation Resolution Boundary

`IValidationResolutionBoundary` acts as the strict architectural separator between unresolved definitions and runtime validation artifacts.

- **Role:** A structural abstraction defining the transition from `IValidationDefinition` to `IResolvedValidation`.
- **Constraint:** Does not imply or define validation behavior, validation rules, execution order, processing logic, validation algorithms, execution engines, orchestration, scheduling, concurrency, threading, queues, or state machines. It is a conceptual architectural separator only.

## 8. Resolved Validation

`IResolvedValidation` represents the immutable runtime artifact produced only after crossing the Validation Resolution Boundary.

- **Role:** Contains purely resolved validation information.
- **Constraint:** Must not reference `IValidationDefinition`, the `IValidationResolutionBoundary`, validation engines, runtime services, orchestration components, or business entities.

## 9. Validation State

`IValidationState` describes the conceptual condition of validation.

- **Role:** Represents the current status and condition parameters.
- **Constraint:** Strictly independent of Validation Lifecycle, Pipeline State, Execution State, Artifact State, Source State, Configuration State, Provider State, and Import Job State.

## 10. Validation Lifecycle

Validation Lifecycle describes the conceptual transitions a validation artifact undergoes (e.g., defined, resolving, resolved).

- **Role:** Represents structural phase transitions.
- **Constraint:** Completely distinct from `IValidationState`.

## 11. Compatibility Model

`IValidationCompatibility` represents a generic, purely declarative architectural model for compatibility statements.

- **Role:** Declares compatibility as read-only statements.
- **Constraint:** Does not imply or define runtime compatibility, execution compatibility, platform assumptions, compatibility verification, or negotiation.

## 12. Component Relationships

Relationships are strictly structural, enforcing separation of concerns:

- `IValidationDefinition` **owns** `IValidationMetadata`.
- `IValidationMetadata` **owns** `IValidationIdentity` and `IValidationCompatibility`.
- `IValidationResolutionBoundary` **separates** `IValidationDefinition` and `IValidationContext` from `IResolvedValidation`.

## 13. Dependency Analysis

The dependency graph flows strictly downward:

- Architectural consumers interact with Validation abstractions exclusively through the `IValidationResolutionBoundary`.
- `IResolvedValidation` has zero architectural dependencies on `IValidationDefinition` or the Resolution Boundary.
- There are no references or dependencies on runtime orchestrators, validation engines, or algorithms, ensuring complete architectural independence.

## 14. Namespace Consistency & Architectural Rationale

To maintain namespace consistency with previous phases, the `validation` namespace is retained.
**Collision Avoidance Rationale:** Phase 6.6 previously populated the `validation` namespace with core validation contracts (e.g., `IValidationDefinition`, `IValidationContext`, `IValidationResolutionBoundary`). To strictly adhere to the mandate **"Do NOT modify existing contracts"**, this design avoids collisions by NOT re-declaring or modifying the existing Phase 6.6 contracts, which already satisfy structural requirements. The architectural necessity of Phase 6.11 is to complete the pattern by introducing `IResolvedValidation` into the existing `validation` namespace as an additive runtime artifact. No existing files are modified, ensuring zero collisions and perfect backward compatibility.

## 15. File Planning

The following files are strictly required for Phase 6.11B:

- `packages/domain/src/import-foundation/contracts/validation/IResolvedValidation.ts`
- `packages/domain/tests/import-foundation/contracts/validation/ResolvedValidation.spec.ts`

_(Note: All other Validation contracts defined in this architecture were successfully implemented in Phase 6.6. They remain untouched to honor the "Do NOT modify existing contracts" rule.)_

## 16. Risk Assessment

- **Risk:** Leakage of validation rules or execution engines into the Resolution Boundary.
  - **Mitigation:** Strict enforcement of the boundary as a pure structural abstraction devoid of processing logic.
- **Risk:** Unintentional mutation of `IValidationContext` by consumers.
  - **Mitigation:** Strict structural immutability enforced on the contract interfaces.

## 17. Architecture Validation

- **Compatibility:** Fully integrates with Phases 6.1–6.10 and guarantees compatibility with Phase 6.12.
- **Domain-Agnostic:** Contains zero domain knowledge.
- **Technology-Independent:** Holds no assumptions regarding execution engines, threading, or infrastructure.
- **Zero Business Logic:** Exclusively architectural contracts.

## 18. Explicit Non-Goals

- No implementation of validation engines, rules, or algorithms.
- No execution scheduling, concurrency, threading, or queues.
- No parsing, mapping, logging, metrics, AI, or translation.

## 19. Confirmation of No Breaking Changes

This architecture is entirely additive. It introduces a refined declarative foundation for `IResolvedValidation` and does not modify, deprecate, or break any existing contracts from Phases 6.1 through 6.10.
