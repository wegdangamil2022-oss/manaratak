## Part B — User Personas & User Objectives

### 22.B.1 Product Users Philosophy Contracts

**Architectural Commentary**  
The product experience is fundamentally built upon an inclusive definition of its user base. To categorize the platform as merely a "student portal" undermines the enterprise vision. These conceptual contracts define the systemic experience scope for anyone seeking educational opportunities.

```typescript
/**
 * Conceptual product-experience contract defining audience experience scope.
 */
export interface IProductUserPhilosophyRequirement {
  targetAudience: string; // "Anyone seeking educational opportunities or development"
  isLimitedToStudents: boolean; // false
  supportedPursuits: string[]; // ['Learning', 'Academic Growth', 'Professional Development', 'Scholarships', 'Universities', 'Educational Resources']
}
```

---

### 22.B.2 Primary User Contracts

**Architectural Commentary**  
By stripping away demographic constraints, the experience architecture identifies a singular, unifying persona that drives the ecosystem: the opportunity seeker.

```typescript
/**
 * Conceptual persona contract defining the primary experience persona.
 */
export interface IPrimaryUserPersona {
  personaId: string;
  coreIntent: string; // "Searching for educational opportunities"
  demographicConstraints: null; // Agnostic to age, academic level, or background
}
```

---

### 22.B.3 User Categories Contracts

**Architectural Commentary**  
Users are categorized by their immediate, active objectives rather than static identities. This goal-oriented categorization ensures the platform experience responds dynamically to what users want to achieve.

```typescript
export interface IUserCategoryRequirement {
  categoryId: string;
  primaryGoal: string;
}

export interface IScholarshipSeekerRequirement extends IUserCategoryRequirement {}
export interface IUniversitySeekerRequirement extends IUserCategoryRequirement {}
export interface IMajorSeekerRequirement extends IUserCategoryRequirement {}
export interface ICountrySeekerRequirement extends IUserCategoryRequirement {}
export interface IOnlineCourseSeekerRequirement extends IUserCategoryRequirement {}
export interface ILanguageTestSeekerRequirement extends IUserCategoryRequirement {}
export interface IEducationalToolUserRequirement extends IUserCategoryRequirement {}
export interface IEducationalServiceSeekerRequirement extends IUserCategoryRequirement {}
export interface IInternshipSeekerRequirement extends IUserCategoryRequirement {}
export interface ICareerOpportunitySeekerRequirement extends IUserCategoryRequirement {}
export interface IEducationalInformationSeekerRequirement extends IUserCategoryRequirement {}
```

---

### 22.B.4 User Priorities Contracts

**Architectural Commentary**  
Understanding user demand vectors dictates the visual hierarchy and systemic prioritization of the platform interface experience.

```typescript
/**
 * The structural hierarchy of user priorities driving the interface experience.
 */
export interface IUserPriorityRequirement {
  priorityLevel: number;
  domain: string;
}

export const ExpectedUserPriorities: IUserPriorityRequirement[] = [
  { priorityLevel: 1, domain: 'Scholarships' },
  { priorityLevel: 2, domain: 'Universities' },
  { priorityLevel: 3, domain: 'Majors' },
  { priorityLevel: 4, domain: 'Countries' },
  { priorityLevel: 5, domain: 'Courses' },
  { priorityLevel: 6, domain: 'Educational Tools' },
  { priorityLevel: 7, domain: 'Educational Services' },
  { priorityLevel: 8, domain: 'Articles and Educational Guides' },
];
```

---

### 22.B.5 User Access Philosophy Contracts

**Architectural Commentary**  
The platform follows a Progressive Access model. Users explore vast portions of the platform anonymously without registration, converting to authenticated states only when personal workspace features or transaction fulfillment are required.

```typescript
export interface IUserAccessPhilosophyRequirement {
  accessModel: string; // "Progressive Access"
  allowsUnregisteredExploration: boolean; // true
  requiresAuthenticationForWorkspace: boolean; // true
}
```

---

### 22.B.6 Registered User Workspace Requirements (Consumed by Phase 15)

**Architectural Commentary**  
Phase 22 defines the user experience expectations for the authenticated workspace. However, private user state, persistence, search history, saved items, and personal workspace behavior are owned and implemented by **Phase 15 — Enterprise Student Platform**.

```typescript
/**
 * Conceptual experience contract for workspace capabilities.
 * Actual state management and execution are owned by Phase 15.
 */
export interface IRegisteredUserWorkspaceRequirement {
  workspaceId: string;
  userId: string;
  consumedFeatures: IWorkspaceFeatureExpectation[];
}

export interface IWorkspaceFeatureExpectation {
  featureName: string;
  owningDomain: string; // 'Phase 15 — Enterprise Student Platform'
}

export interface IPersonalProfileRequirement extends IWorkspaceFeatureExpectation {}
export interface ISavedScholarshipsRequirement extends IWorkspaceFeatureExpectation {}
export interface ISavedUniversitiesRequirement extends IWorkspaceFeatureExpectation {}
export interface ISavedCountriesRequirement extends IWorkspaceFeatureExpectation {}
export interface ISavedMajorsRequirement extends IWorkspaceFeatureExpectation {}
export interface ISavedCoursesRequirement extends IWorkspaceFeatureExpectation {}
export interface IEducationalCertificatesRequirement extends IWorkspaceFeatureExpectation {}
export interface ICompletedCoursesRequirement extends IWorkspaceFeatureExpectation {}
export interface INotificationsDisplayRequirement extends IWorkspaceFeatureExpectation {}
export interface IPersonalRecommendationsExpectation extends IWorkspaceFeatureExpectation {}
export interface ISearchHistoryRequirement extends IWorkspaceFeatureExpectation {}
export interface IActivityHistoryRequirement extends IWorkspaceFeatureExpectation {}
export interface IEducationalProgressRequirement extends IWorkspaceFeatureExpectation {}
export interface IAccountSettingsRequirement extends IWorkspaceFeatureExpectation {}
```

---

### 22.B.7 User Experience Consistency Contracts

**Architectural Commentary**  
The experience architecture explicitly rejects fragmented interfaces. All users experience a singular, unified platform environment, navigating naturally toward their specific goals.

```typescript
export interface IExperienceConsistencyRequirement {
  isUnifiedInterface: boolean; // true
  hasFragmentedPublicInterfaces: boolean; // false
  navigationParadigm: string; // "Natural Goal-Oriented Navigation"
}
```

---

### 22.B.8 User Objectives Contracts

**Architectural Commentary**  
The platform surrounds users with the tools necessary to complete their entire educational journey within an integrated ecosystem, addressing both immediate and longitudinal goals.

```typescript
export interface IUserObjectiveRequirement {
  objectiveId: string;
  description: string;
}

export interface IDiscoverOpportunitiesRequirement extends IUserObjectiveRequirement {}
export interface ICompareOpportunitiesRequirement extends IUserObjectiveRequirement {}
export interface ISaveOpportunitiesRequirement extends IUserObjectiveRequirement {}
export interface ILearnRequirement extends IUserObjectiveRequirement {}
export interface IExploreUniversitiesRequirement extends IUserObjectiveRequirement {}
export interface IExploreCountriesRequirement extends IUserObjectiveRequirement {}
export interface IUseEducationalToolsRequirement extends IUserObjectiveRequirement {}
export interface IAccessEducationalServicesRequirement extends IUserObjectiveRequirement {}
export interface ITrackPersonalProgressRequirement extends IUserObjectiveRequirement {}
```

---

### 22.B.9 Intelligence & Search Neutrality Requirements

**Architectural Commentary**  
Search and personalized recommendations are defined strictly as user experience requirements:
- **Phase 17 — Enterprise AI Platform:** Owns AI recommendation scoring, ranking assistance, guided matching, and opportunity suggestions.
- **Search & Notification Infrastructure:** Search journeys are experience flows; search indexing and query engines rely on core adapters. Notifications display user alerts, while event dispatching relies on the platform event bus. No standalone Search Platform or Notification Platform exists.

---

### 22.B.10 Ownership & Governance Rules

- **Experience Governance Authority:** Phase 22 exclusively owns the UX principles, user personas, user objectives, progressive access rules, and cross-domain experience consistency.
- **Domain Boundaries:** Phase 22 does NOT own database schemas, identity tokens, CMS content lifecycle, AI recommendation engines, or backend APIs.
- **Workspace State Delegation:** Phase 15 — Enterprise Student Platform owns all private user state, saved items storage, and authenticated workspace behavior.
- **Public Composition Delegation:** Phase 24 — Enterprise Public Platform owns public layout rendering, homepage assembly, and SEO presentation.

---

### 22.B.11 Validation Rules

**Architectural Commentary**  
Validation contracts verify that experience expectations remain consistent with core principles.

```typescript
export interface IExperienceRequirementValidation {
  validateUnifiedInterfaceConsistency(): boolean;
  validateProgressiveAccessCompliance(): boolean;
  validatePhase15WorkspaceDelegation(): boolean;
}
```

---

### 22.B.12 Architecture Constraints

- **No Fragmented Portals:** The system MUST NOT create separate public-facing portals for different demographic groups.
- **Progressive Onboarding:** The system MUST NOT enforce mandatory registration walls before allowing catalog exploration.
- **No Persistence in Phase 22:** Phase 22 MUST NOT define database tables, ORM models, or persistence schemas.
- **Agnostic Routing:** The experience MUST route users based on selected intent, not static demographic assumptions.

---

### 22.B.13 Final Contracts Review

- **Contract Validation:** Validated. Conceptual product-experience requirement contracts are fully specified for user personas, access models, and workspace expectations.
- **Ownership Validation:** Validated. Phase 22 governs product experience without overriding underlying domain logic or persistence.
- **Workspace Delegation Validation:** Validated. All registered workspace features are explicitly delegated to Phase 15 — Enterprise Student Platform.
- **AI & Public Delegation Validation:** Validated. AI engines belong to Phase 17; public page rendering belongs to Phase 24.
- **Readiness Review:** Approved for baseline.
