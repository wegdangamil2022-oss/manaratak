## 5. Design Baseline Approval

This document is the approved UI/UX requirements baseline for MANARATAK public pages.
It is the implementation reference for public page structure, page sections, public cards, routing expectations, SEO composition, empty states, trust states, and cross-page related-content layout.
It does not transfer domain ownership to Phase 24.
All data, content, workflows, payments, assets, certificates, tools, learning records, services, career records, and admin controls remain owned by their official Roadmap v6.0 phases.
Phase 24 owns only public page composition, visitor-facing presentation, routing, SEO application, public layout, listing/comparison rendering, and UI orchestration of approved public read models.
Future changes to this document require documentation governance review before implementation changes are made.

### Scope of Authority
- This document governs UI/UX composition and public-page layout only.
- It does not govern backend persistence schemas.
- It does not govern domain business rules.
- It does not govern API ownership.
- It does not govern admin workflows.
- It does not govern AI execution.
- It does not govern import mechanics.
- It does not govern payment execution.
- It does not govern certificate issuance.
- It does not govern file/media storage.
- It does not introduce any new phase.

### Change Control Rule
- Any future addition of a new public page type, major section, or ownership change must reference Roadmap v6.0, the relevant domain phase, and active ADRs.
- No new public page may create a new domain owner.
- No public page requirement may introduce Phase 25, Organizations Platform, Employers Platform, standalone Search Platform, or any unapproved bounded context.
- Public page changes must preserve Phase 24 composition-only ownership.
