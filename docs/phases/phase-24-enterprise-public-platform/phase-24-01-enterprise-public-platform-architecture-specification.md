## Part A — Public Platform Vision & Boundaries

### 24.A.1 Public Platform Vision

**Architectural Commentary**  
The MANARATAK Enterprise Public Platform is architected as the unified public discovery, presentation, and composition tier for students globally seeking educational opportunities within the fixed 24-phase Roadmap v6.0.

The vision of the platform transcends a standard directory. It is engineered to present and compose the entire educational discovery journey—from initial exploration to decision-making—through one fully integrated, macroscopic public ecosystem.

---

### 24.A.2 Public Platform Mission

**Architectural Commentary**  
The mission of the MANARATAK Public Platform is to radically simplify educational discovery by organizing disparate global educational opportunities into one trusted, structured, and continuously maintained public platform.

By standardizing and presenting fragmented educational data supplied by underlying domain engines, the platform empowers students to make informed, life-altering decisions without navigating disorganized, isolated information silos.

---

### 24.A.3 First User Impression

**Architectural Commentary**  
The public platform must instantly command authority. The architectural design of the experience guarantees that the first user impression instantaneously communicates organizational clarity and systemic reliability.

Upon visiting MANARATAK, visitors must immediately experience:
- **Organization:** Every data point is predictable, structured, and cleanly formatted.
- **Professionalism:** The ecosystem operates at an enterprise tier.
- **Trust:** Data presented is authoritative, verified, and safely governed.
- **Simplicity:** Structural complexity is abstracted behind intuitive public navigation.
- **Educational Quality:** High-caliber opportunities, programs, and institutions are represented.
- **Completeness:** A holistic educational discovery hub that links related academic opportunities.

---

### 24.A.4 Educational Philosophy & Connected Knowledge

**Architectural Commentary**  
The platform treats education as a connected relational graph. Educational entities do not exist in isolation; they complement one another to form a cohesive network of knowledge.

The architecture ensures that educational terminology inside public content automatically becomes a meaningful navigational opportunity. Examples of connected knowledge pathways include:
- **Scholarships connect to Majors:** A scholarship eligibility requirement pathways to the exploration of that specific major.
- **Majors connect to Universities:** Discovering a major leads directly to the institutions that offer it.
- **Majors connect to Courses:** Academic disciplines route to available preparatory or core courses.
- **Courses connect to Educational Services:** Course enrollment pathways logically to advisory or credentialing services.
- **Educational Services connect to Student Tools:** Service execution seamlessly integrates with AI-assisted student tools (e.g., encountering a "Motivation Letter" requirement within a scholarship links to the Motivation Letter Student Tool).

---

### 24.A.5 Public Platform & Administration Relationship

**Architectural Commentary**  
The relationship between Phase 24 — Enterprise Public Platform and Phase 23 — Enterprise Administration Portal is strictly governed by command and presentation separation:

- **Command Authority:** Phase 23 issues administrative publication, unpublication, section visibility, and feature-toggle commands through approved domain APIs and event dispatchers.
- **Composition Ownership:** Phase 24 owns final public page composition, visitor routing, SEO rendering, client-side layout assembly, and visitor-facing page state.
- **Domain Record Origin:** Published domain records originate exclusively from their owning domain platforms (Phase 07 Countries, Phase 11 Universities, Phase 12 Scholarships, Phase 13 Courses, Phase 16 CMS, Phase 18 Tools, Phase 20 Services, Phase 21 Career/Alumni), NOT from Phase 23 or Phase 24.

Phase 24 presents a pristine, real-time reflection of approved domain records based on administrative visibility commands.

---

### 24.A.6 Brand Identity

**Architectural Commentary**  
The brand identity is a structural attribute of the platform. MANARATAK is recognized as the definitive educational platform for Arabic-speaking students and international scholars.

The platform consistently represents:
- **Educational Excellence:** Uncompromising quality in data presentation.
- **Professionalism:** Enterprise-grade aesthetic and layout stability.
- **Trust:** Accuracy and clear verification signals.
- **Organization:** Structured presentation of complex global educational data.
- **Simplicity:** Elegant abstraction of administrative complexity.
- **Accessibility:** Responsive, high-availability public experience across all devices.

---

### 24.A.7 Growth & Roadmap Scalability

**Architectural Commentary**  
The public platform is engineered as a scalable composition chassis strictly bounded to approved roadmap-scoped entities within the fixed 24-phase Roadmap v6.0.

The architecture ensures that approved domain entities, AI-assisted student tools, educational services, country guides, and university catalogs can be cleanly rendered without requiring structural redesign. Phase 24 strictly prohibits adding unapproved domains, open-ended future sections outside Roadmap v6.0, or un-scoped platform expansions.

---

### 24.A.8 Phase 24 Ownership & Boundary Rules

**Architectural Commentary**  
To prevent architectural drift and maintain clean separation of concerns, the ownership boundaries of Phase 24 are explicitly defined:

#### Phase 24 OWNS:
- Public page composition, layout assembly, and responsive rendering.
- Homepage structure, section arrangement, and hero presentation.
- Public catalog navigation, category routing, and public search presentation.
- Visitor-facing detail page rendering and anonymous exploration flows.
- Public read-model aggregation and SEO page composition.

#### Phase 24 DOES NOT OWN:

### 24.A.9 Domain Detail Page Composition Rules

**Architectural Commentary**  
Phase 24 composes public detail pages by consuming structured read-model DTOs from their respective domain owners:

- **Country Destination Pages:** Phase 07 owns canonical reference country data; Phase 16 owns editorial country guides; Phase 24 composes the public country destination page.
- **University Detail Pages:** Phase 11 owns university records, campuses, and rankings; Phase 16 owns editorial content; Phase 24 composes the public university detail page.
- **Scholarship Detail Pages:** Phase 12 owns scholarship definitions, eligibility criteria, and domain state; Phase 16 owns editorial copy; Phase 24 composes the public scholarship detail page.
- **Course Detail Pages:** Phase 13 owns course catalog data, origin types, provider metadata, and course lifecycles; Phase 24 composes the public course detail page.
- **Certificate Verification Pages:** Phase 14 owns certificate verification logic; Phase 24 composes the public verification interface.
- **CMS Articles & Guides:** Phase 16 owns editorial articles, categories, and content blocks; Phase 24 composes the public article reading experience.
- **Educational Tools & AI-Assisted Student Tools:** Phase 18 owns tool definitions; Phase 17 owns AI generation; Phase 24 composes the public tool interface and access surfaces.
- **Educational Services Pages:** Phase 20 owns service offerings and fulfillment workflows; Phase 24 composes public service landing pages.
- **Career & Alumni Public Views:** Phase 21 owns career metadata, alumni profiles, and recruitment employer read-models; Phase 24 composes public career and employer read-model pages.

### 24.A.10 Core Platform Principles

**Architectural Commentary**  
These enterprise principles govern the public platform vision and design:
- **Organization First:** Structured presentation supersedes decorative experimentation.
- **Educational Value:** Content presentation prioritizes academic clarity and utility.
- **Trust & Transparency:** Clear data sourcing, verification badges, and last-updated timestamps.
- **Boundary Integrity:** Clean delegation of domain state to owning phases.
- **Roadmap Compliance:** Bounded strictly to the fixed 24-phase Roadmap v6.0.

---

### 24.A.11 Enterprise Review & Acceptance

**Architectural Commentary**  
The following criteria constitute formal governance gates for Phase 24 Part A:

- **Vision & Scope Validation:** Validated. Phase 24 is explicitly defined as the public composition and discovery platform within Roadmap v6.0.
- **Boundary Validation:** Validated. Domain ownership, student workspace state, CMS authoring, AI execution, and admin controls are cleanly delegated to their respective owning phases.
- **Governance Validation:** Validated. Command separation between Phase 23 (admin commands) and Phase 24 (public composition) is locked.
- **Readiness Review:** Approved for baseline.

**Status:** APPROVED FOR BASELINE / DOCUMENTATION READY  
**Approver:** Chief Enterprise Architect & Architecture Review Board (ARB)  

## 24.12 Cross-Phase Alignment: Academic Taxonomy (Phase 08)

**Taxonomy Consumption Rules:**
- **Exposure:** The public platform may expose taxonomy-driven filters, categories, and labels ONLY after approved/published domain data exists.
- **Indirect Consumption:** Public major pages and country destination pages should consume Phase 08 taxonomy indirectly through approved Phase 10 (Majors), Phase 11 (Universities), or Phase 12 (Scholarships) data.
- **Strict Prohibition:** The public platform MUST NOT expose staged, imported, draft, or unreviewed taxonomy data.
