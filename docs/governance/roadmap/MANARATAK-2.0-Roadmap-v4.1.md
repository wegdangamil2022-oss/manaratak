# MANARATAK-2.0-Roadmap-v4.1

## 1. Document Information

- **Title:** MANARATAK 2.0 Official Enterprise Roadmap
- **Version:** 4.1
- **Status:** Approved & Finalized
- **Approval Status:** Formal Baseline
- **Authors:** Chief Enterprise Software Architect
- **Last Updated:** 2026-07-19
- **Baseline:** Phase 1 to Phase 9 Completed

## 2. Revision History

- **v4.1:** Foundation completion formally recognized; Phase 8 (Academic Taxonomy) introduced; Phase renumbering updated; Dependency updates verified; Architecture governance updates (Phases 1.30, 1.31, 1.32) finalized and integrated.
- **v4.0:** Major modular monolith realignment; Domain-Driven Design boundaries codified.
- **v3.2:** Initial CI/CD pipeline integration and security baseline established.

## 3. Executive Summary

This document serves as the official Enterprise Roadmap for the MANARATAK 2.0 platform. Following the successful completion and formal architectural sign-off of the Enterprise Foundation (Phases 1 through 9), the enterprise is now positioned to commence domain-specific implementations. The immediate priority is the Phase 11 (Universities & Institutions), which will leverage the robust capabilities codified within the foundational Modular Monolith.

## 4. Current Project Status

- **Completed Phases:** Phase 1 through Phase 9 (Enterprise Foundation Architecture).
- **Current Phase:** Transition from Foundation Validation to Domain Implementation.
- **Next Phase:** Phase 11 (Universities & Institutions).
- **Current Architecture Baseline:** The Enterprise Foundation is complete, internally consistent, governance-ready, scalable, maintainable, and approved as the baseline architecture for all subsequent phases.

## 5. Complete Roadmap

- **Phase 1 – Phase 9:** Enterprise Foundation Architecture (Modular Monolith, Security, Integration, Data Governance, Observability, AI Engine, Universal Import Platform, Background Jobs)
- **Phase 10:** Phase 11 (Universities & Institutions)
- **Phase 11:** Scholarship & Financial Aid Platform
- **Phase 8:** Phase 8 (Academic Taxonomy)
- **Phase 13:** Student Portal & Unified Dashboard
- **Phase 14:** Enterprise CMS Platform
- **Phase 15:** Enterprise AI Platform
- **Phase 16:** Global Alumni Network
- **Phase 17:** Partner & University API Integrations
- **Phase 18:** Platform Scale-Out & Optimization

## 6. Phase Dependencies

- **Phase 11 (Universities & Institutions):** Strictly dependent on the Enterprise Foundation (Phases 1–9) for security, data storage (Canonical Data Model), caching, and observability.
- **Phase 12 (Scholarships):** Dependent on Phase 11 for University and Program references, as well as the Academic Taxonomy.
- **Phase 8 (Academic Taxonomy):** Operates closely with Phase 11 to structure domains of study, but relies entirely on Foundation capabilities for CMS and classification storage.
- **Phases 13-18:** Sequentially dependent on the underlying Domain APIs established in Phases 10–12. All future phases depend implicitly on the Governance and Architecture Decision Records (ADR) established in Phase 1.31.

## 7. Milestone Status

- **Enterprise Foundation (Phases 1-9):** Completed
- **Phase 1.30-1.32 Governance Checkpoints:** Completed
- **Transition to Implementation:** In Progress
- **Phase 11 (Universities & Institutions):** Planned (Next Immediate Milestone)
- **Phase 12 (Scholarships):** Future
- **Phase 8 (Academic Taxonomy):** Future
- **Phases 13-18:** Future

## 8. Architecture Freeze Status

- **Enterprise Foundation (Phases 1-9):** Frozen
- **Phase 11 (Universities & Institutions):** Draft
- **Phase 12 (Scholarships) (Phase 11):** Draft
- **Phase 8 (Academic Taxonomy) (Phase 12):** Draft
- **AI Engine (Foundation Layer):** Stable
- **Universal Import Platform:** Stable

## 9. Upcoming Work

The next immediate milestone must be:
**Phase 11 (Universities & Institutions)**
Work will commence on defining the bounded contexts, aggregates, and domain services required to manage universities, campuses, programs, and admission criteria, strictly adhering to the finalized Foundation Architecture.

## 10. Final Baseline Approval

The Enterprise Foundation is formally approved. Version 4.1 of the MANARATAK 2.0 Roadmap is hereby adopted as the single source of truth for project sequencing and strategic technical execution.
